# Welcome to the B² network organization repos

## Vision

[B² network](https://www.bsquared.network/) is building the settlement backbone for the AI era — where Bitcoin is no longer just "digital gold", but the currency of autonomous agents.
We believe that:

1. Bitcoin is the most secure, scarce, and censorship-resistant digital asset.
2. AI Agents are becoming new economic actors, requiring native wallets and settlement tools.
3. Stablecoins provide the predictable pricing and liquidity layer that makes large-scale adoption possible.

By uniting these three forces, B² Network transforms Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active medium of exchange for the AI economy.


## Core Products

B² Network is designed as a modular Bitcoin + AI settlement infrastructure. The architecture is built around five tightly connected modules, each solving a key challenge in unifying Bitcoin, AI Agents, and Stablecoin economies:

1. Mining² (launched on 2025.03.27) Connects Bitcoin miners to the network by routing hashrate and BTC revenues into staking pools, agent wallets, and validator incentives. It bridges Proof-of-Work security with Proof-of-Signal governance.
2. B² Hub (Layer 1.5 PoSg Consensus, launched on 2024.04.12) A sovereign “Layer 1.5” chain powered by Proof-of-Signal + Stake (PoSg).
3. B² Rollup (BTC-Anchored L2 Execution Layer, launched on 2024.04.15) An EVM-compatible rollup environment with high throughput and native BTC-denominated gas.
4. AI Signal (Signal-Driven Agentic AI Layer, published on 2025.05.13) The protocol layer that integrates autonomous AI agents directly into blockchain consensus.
5. U2 Stablecoin (BTC-Collateralized Settlement Layer, published on 2025.09.01, will launch on 2025.10) A Bitcoin-backed stablecoin designed for micro-payments and predictable pricing.
